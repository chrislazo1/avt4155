	<h2>Quick Summary</h2>
	<p>This Easy Skillet Chicken Thigh recipe with a simple garlic cream sauce is the perfect chicken dinner for easy weeknights or entertaining. Everyone loves this juicy chicken dish and it takes less than 30 minutes to make!</p>
	<h2>Key Ingredients</h2>
	<p>The ingredients are simple, but put them all together and you will end up with the most amazing chicken dinner!</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Chicken thighs– you will need about 1 ½ pounds of chicken. You can use skin-on or skinless chicken thighs, whatever you prefer. Chicken thighs with the skin will have more flavor and the skin will get nice and crispy. Technically, you can use chicken breasts, but we recommend thighs because they are juicier.</li>
	<li>Spices– onion powder, garlic powder, and paprika create a great rub for the chicken.</li>
	<li>Olive oil– for cooking the chicken.</li>
	<li>Butter– to create a rich and delicious sauce.</li>
	<li>Shallot– look for shallot by the garlic at the grocery store.</li>
	<li>Garlic– for flavor!</li>
	<li>Chicken broth– for the sauce. You can also use white wine.</li>
	<li>Lemon juice– to brighten up the sauce.</li>
	<li>Thyme– fresh thyme goes so well with the chicken.</li>
	<li>Crushed red pepper flakes– for a little heat.</li>
	<li>Heavy cream– to finish the sauce, don’t skip it! It takes the sauce to the next level.</li>
	<li>Parsley-for garnish!</li>
	</ul>
